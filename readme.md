## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

CG Rust is an abbreviation for "**C**omputational **G**eometry for **Rust**" and is intended
to become an library full of spatial data structures and algorithms for them e.g. cutting polygons,
finding nearest neighbors in a KD-Tree etc.

However, at the moment, the library (and my rust skills) are at very beginnings and I am publishing it very early
to keep myself motivated ^^

Right now, only a very basic SIMD Vector class is included.
